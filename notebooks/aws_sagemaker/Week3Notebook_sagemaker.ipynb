    "Welcome to the sagemaker integration for cmle, the goal of this notebook is to show you an example of how to featurize data that currently lives in the dlz and bring that data into the sagemaker environment.   The notebook simulates the equivalent of the original Week3 notebook by loading in custom jars that are necessary to launch a spark session and then initiate model training by running mlflow locally within the sagemaker environment.  The goal is to show how to launch mlflow within the sagemaker docker image that is used to run this notebook.  Fundamentally all other parts of the notebook stay the same as the original Week3 notebook."

    "A lot of this information can be found in MLFlow by going into the Experiments and querying through the UI, selecting the experiment group (typically the name of this notebook), and then expanding the experiment container that we started with hyperopt and selecting the individual trials here. After clicking on Compare you will see a few visualizations to understand the results of the tuning better.\n",

This can help identify whether there are some outliers, and if there is a general trend emerging that could be caught by visual inspection. We use plotly to draw the graph, and also add additional hover data to each scatter point representing the hyper-parameters used for that trial."
